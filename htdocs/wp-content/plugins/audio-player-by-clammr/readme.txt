Audio Player that makes your content shareable & viral. Listeners share highlights to Facebook & Twitter with link back to your full audio.

== Description ==

Do you want to make it easy for your visitors to share their favorite audio highlights with their friends? The Clammr audio player brings social networking to audio. As visitors listen to audio that you post, they can tap the integrated Clammr Button to tag their favorite highlights and share them to Facebook or Twitter. The shared highlights contain links back to your full audio and site, driving additional audience and traffic to you.

We were built in partnership with the awesome Blubrry team behind PowerPress. We recommend installing Blubrry's PowerPress if you don't already have it so that you can take advantage of all of Blubrry's great services.  While the Clammr audio player is also a standalone plug-in that you can use on its own, we recommend going into settings in Blubrry's PowerPress to enable the Clammr Audio Player.

If you're looking for a premium player designed to grow your audience and build your email list, check out our friends at Simple Podcast Press. They have the Clammr Button directly integrated alongside a full suite of tools geared towards getting your audios in front of more listeners. You can even set it up to publish your podcasts to your WordPress site automatically.

The Clammr Audio Player is compatible with all major browsers and is mobile responsive. Place the audio player exactly where you want by adding the [audio-clammr] shortcode directly into your post content.
